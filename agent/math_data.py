ISO_DEFINITION = f"""Definition of graph isomorphism:
        In graph theory, an isomorphism of graphs G and H is a bijection f between the vertex sets of G and H, denoted as f: V(G) -> V(H). G and H are said to be isomorphic when f satisfies the following: any two vertices u and v of G are adjacent in G if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in H. This kind of bijection is commonly described as "edge-preserving bijection", in accordance with the general notion of isomorphism being a structure-preserving bijection.
